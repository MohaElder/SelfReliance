  Description: "Asset Hunter 2 is the top project cleaning tool of the Asset Store.\nUsing
    it is simple and it allows for one-button cleanup.\n\nIs this a tool for me?  \nAre
    you trying to go below a certain buildsize? \nAre all the old placeholder graphics
    and models cluttering up your project?\nDidn't you ever get around to delete the
    auto generated materials after model import? \nDo you have bunch of assets in
    your project, but is only using a small number of them? \nDoes it seem like too
    large a task to remove obsolete assets?\n\nIf any of the above applies to you,
    Asset Hunter is the tool for you.\n\nAsset Hunter is a tool that analyzes your
    buildlog and gives you an easily understandable overview over unused assets in
    your project folder.  The results are grouped into folders and file types, making
    it easy to start cleaning up your project. Additionally it lists the uncompressed
    size of all the assets used in the build, enabling you to better downsize your
    buildsize. If you want to know which scenes are using a specific asset, Asset
    Hunter can tell you that too!"
